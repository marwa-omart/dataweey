Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

First, I investigated the size of the problem. Second,I investigated each characteristic and its coorrelation with not showing up to an appointment in a form of a research question about each characteristic and its impact on the problem of not showing. Third,I investigated the impact of the waiting duration and the clinic crowded days on the patient not showing.

Research Questions
How big is the problem?, in other words, How many patients didn't show up to their appointment?
Do SMS reminders decrease the number of absences?
How is age affecting the patient's absence? (Age groups classification)
Are chronic illnesses like hypertension and diabetes affecting patient's absences?
Is alcoholism a prominent factor in patient's absences? Are the absences frequent?
Do disabilities affect patient's absences
Are no-show appointments associated with a certain gender?
Do patients who don't have scholarships affect their absences
Is the period between scheduled day and appointment day affecting the number of no-show appointments?
Do patients tend to skip their appointment if the clinic is crowded?
